5,Super!,"It has been two days since I started using this phone. I was a bit wary of purchasing realme 6 pro being an avid iPhone user but it has proved me wrong in all the aspects.
It has fabulous display, good battery (at least better than my iPhone), has a very good sound quality and comes with myriad of features in such low budget.

Also it has lots of safety features. Two things which might not be important but is essential is that it removes and merges duplicate contacts unlike Xiaomi Or iphones...."

* Fantastic and perfect cameras. 100% value for your money. PERFECT results. I am over satisfied (I am also a DSLR photographer). The zoom is REALLY good, try it in the daylight. Night mode is much superior as compared to the other handsets. The best part is that it has a front-facing ultra-wide-angle selfie camera too. Trust me, you'll NEVER regret once you buy it.

3,Does the job,"I was using Oppo F3 Plus gold prior to buying this mobile.I have exchanged my Oppo F3 Plus with this phone. I love listening to music on speakers. For some reason the speaker of realme 6 Pro is very distortive and very different sound. I have tried connecting to my home theatre through audio Jack, It's not that great.
Display at times Flickr. After yesterday software update its quiet different. Overall I rate 3 out of 5 for this phone as per my needs and expectations."

4,Really Nice,"The device could have been much more slimmer. Feels big in hand.

Build quality feels strong

Looks awesome from behind

Display is impressive, one cannot easily differentiate between this and an amoled display.

Major con is, too much bloatware. Few 3rd party apps can be uninstalled but many apps cannot be uninstalled.

,Slightly disappointed,"So many draw backs to this mobile.
1. Mainly there is no notification light very disappointed.
2. phone was slow even you clear the cache memory
3. Lot of software (Realme UI) related issues.
4. Camera zooming is very very bad( just like VGA camera)
5. This realme UI is replica of Color OS.
Pro's

,Useless product,"It's unsatisfactory product.vibration is horrible, sometimes hangs, finishing is not good, only camera is good. No IR sensor, single vibration option. Price is very high as per specifications"
,Phone is Extremly poor in Performance.,"Product is not as per expectation.
Looking good but when we talk about of Redmi 6 Pro on ground performance use i found many technical lapses which is not acceptable.

1. Bluetooth connectivity with external home speaker is extremely poor sound automatically gone anytime. Very bad experience. you will feel cheated as low quality phone will give you better performance than this phone.

2. If you want mirroring in your TV (with chrome cast or Alexa) it will again disappoint you as signals are ..."

5,Simply awesome,"I'm writing this review after 2 weeks of use

In hand feel: phone is large and difficult for one handed use but the weight distribution is great doesn't feel heavy.

Display is neither dim nor too bright it gets the job done even in outdoor and the 90hz refresh rate makes it feel smooth.

Cameras on the back are good but 20x zoom doesn't give you clear image.

Selfie cameras are good and the camera performance can be improved by updates.

Battery life is amazing (even with 90hz on) I easily..."
