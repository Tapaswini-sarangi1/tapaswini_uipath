3,Does the job,"I was using Oppo F3 Plus gold prior to buying this mobile.I have exchanged my Oppo F3 Plus with this phone. I love listening to music on speakers. For some reason the speaker of realme 6 Pro is very distortive and very different sound. I have tried connecting to my home theatre through audio Jack, It's not that great.
Display at times Flickr. After yesterday software update its quiet different. Overall I rate 3 out of 5 for this phone as per my needs and expectations."
